# jenkins-CICD
Welcome to the DevOps Webpage Deployment Project! This project aims to streamline the deployment process of a web application on a Tomcat server using a robust DevOps pipeline. Leveraging the power of Docker, Jenkins, and Ansible, I've designed a comprehensive solution that automates the building, testing, and deployment stages, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

Project Highlights

**Containerized Deployment**:
Utilize Docker for containerization, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.

**Continuous Integration with Jenkins**: 
Implement continuous integration to automatically build and test your application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

**Efficient Deployment using Ansible**:
Automate the deployment process with Ansible playbooks, ensuring reliable and repeatable deployments.

**Web Application on Tomcat**: 
Deploy your web application on an Apache Tomcat server, a widely-used and reliable servlet container.


Initially, we are going to setup Jenkins server
